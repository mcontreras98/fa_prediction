A sample of the results obtained from each model are shown. 
On the target error panels, from left to right: 
-The first image represents the ground truth.
-The second image represents the reference structure.
-The third image represents the ground truth focal adhesion.
-The fourth image represents the predicted focal adhesion.
-The fifth image represents the reference channel with the predicted focal adhesion.
