# Predicting Focal Adhesion Sites Location and Structure in Endothelial Cells

This work is based on the conditional generative adversarial network developed in the paper "Computational Modeling of Cellular Structures Using Conditional Deep Generative Networks". Some minor modifications were performed on the original work for Focal Adhesion prediction on a new dataset.

The data used was a combination of the data from our own lab and data from the Allen Institute for Cell Science: https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/torch_integrated_cell
